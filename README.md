## Othello \*Updated\*


</div>

### Description

I have updated to give some AI.

This is a version of the old board game othello

- I converted it from DataBasic and was originally written about 5 years ago.

It is not totally complete but will give a good starting point. I will be updating it to allow you to play against the computer (as yet you cannot).

let me know what you think.
 
### More Info
 
You will need the microsoft flex grid for this to work
